                        <p>
                            In general we like to keep things light-hearted at Christmas time, but we can't ignore that many of us have had a difficult year with illness, loss, uncertain employment, and isolation due to COVID-19. With that in mind, here are some examples of Christmas greetings you could use as a starting point to write your own notes of encouragement to friends and family.
                        </p>
